##Farsi Script

Farsi has a long and interesting history. In general, the Iranian languages are known from three periods, namely Old, Middle, and New (Modern). These correspond to three historical eras of Iranian history; Old era being sometime around the Achaemenid Empire (i.e., 400–300 BC), Middle era being the next period most officially around the Sasanian Empire, and New era being the period afterwards down to present day.

According to available documents, **the Persian language** is "the only Iranian language" one and the same language of Persian; that is, **New Persian** is a direct descendant of Middle and Old Persian.

Persian language has between six and eight **vowel** phonemes and twenty-six **consonant phonemes**. It features constrastive strees and syllable-final consonant clusters.

## الفبا alefba (Farsi's Alphabet)

The Farsi alphabet (Farsi: /alefbâye fârsi/ الفبای فارسی) consists 32 letters, most of which have two forms, short and full. In Farsi, words are written from right to left while numbers are written from left to right. Farsi is a writing style based on the Arabic script. It is entirely written cursively. That is, the majority of letters in a word connect to each other. Therefore, the appearance of a letter changes depending on its position: beginning (joined on the left), middle (joined on both sides), end (joined on the right) of a word and some letters are written isolated. This writing style is also implemented on computers.

Whenever the Farsi script is typed, the computer connects the letters to each other. Following is a table showing the Farsi alphabet and how it is pronounced in English. There are also some examples of how those letters would sound if you place them in a word.
